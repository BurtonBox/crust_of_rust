# Crust of Rust – Learning Repository

This repository contains my personal notes and code as I follow along with **Jon Gjengset’s [Crust of Rust](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo)** series.  
The series dives into intermediate and advanced Rust topics, explained through live coding and practical examples.

---

## 📖 Description

The goal of this repository is to:

- Practice and reinforce Rust concepts from the Crust of Rust series  
- Build working implementations of the topics covered  
- Serve as a reference for my own learning and for others interested in Rust
